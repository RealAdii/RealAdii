  ## Work

  currently i'm leading ecosystem at @starkware which is a blockchain infrastructure company that builds zero-knowledge proof-based scaling solutions for Ethereum.

  ## a few of my works (my engineer alter ego)
  
  - [TypeRacer](https://github.com/RealAdii/typeracer) - a typing game where only the fastest prevail. every word is a transaction on Starknet (build using StarkZap)
  - [RafflePunk](https://github.com/RealAdii/rafflepunk) - a platform that lets you create a Raffle instantly or participate in one. (PS: it's onchain on Starknet built using StarkZap) 
  - [sovereign](https://github.com/RealAdii/sovereign-journalist) - AI whistleblowing platform where you can anonymously report anything without revealing your identity (possible
  because of zero-knowledge proofs via Reclaim Protocol (https://reclaimprotocol.org/))
  - [creator lending](https://github.com/RealAdii/creator-credit-react) - creator lending marketing where creators can borrow against their revenue on social media platforms.
  - [morning wire](https://github.com/RealAdii/morning-wire) - CRON that sends me the top wall street news, AI tweets from X, top 5 YC companies (investor memo style) and sends me a
  hacker news style newsletter via email everyday.
  - [free notion](https://github.com/RealAdii/notion-clonee) - clone of notion that runs on local machine and is open source.
  - [reclaim-gmail-zkp](https://github.com/RealAdii/reclaim-gmail-zkp) - verify your gmail inbox without revealing your email via zero-knowledge proofs.
